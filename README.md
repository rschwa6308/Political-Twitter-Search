# Political-Twitter-Search
A graphical utility that allows the user to perform an intelligent search of different politicians' tweets.

The GUI uses Python's Tkinter, and Tweepy is used to access twitter's public API service.

*This application was the winning entry at the 2017 HoCo Hacks coding competition.*
